# Custom-Eye

Project Overview:

Custom Eye is an eCommerce website created as part of my individual learning journey in web development. This project represents my exploration of front-end technologies and design principles while building an engaging online shopping experience for a clothing brand. The site features a clean, modern aesthetic and aims to provide users with an intuitive interface for browsing and purchasing products.

Technologies Used:

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML structures the content, while CSS is utilized for styling and responsive design, ensuring that the site looks great on devices of all sizes. JavaScript enhances user interaction, allowing for dynamic features like image sliders and form validation.

Key Features:

Responsive Design: The site is designed to be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
User-Friendly Navigation: Intuitive navigation menus help users easily browse categories, view product details, and access their shopping cart.
Product Display: The website showcases a range of clothing items with high-quality images, descriptions, and pricing, allowing users to make informed purchasing decisions.
Interactive Elements: JavaScript is employed to create interactive features, such as modals for product details and real-time updates to the shopping cart.
Development Process:

I utilized Git and Git Bash for version control throughout the development process, allowing me to track changes, collaborate effectively, and manage my codebase efficiently. This project has been instrumental in deepening my understanding of web development workflows and best practices.

Conclusion:

Custom Eye not only serves as a portfolio piece but also reflects my commitment to continuous learning and improvement in web development. I welcome feedback and contributions from the community to further enhance the project. Explore the repository to see the code and learn more about my development process!
